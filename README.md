# Devs-In-The-Detail
we will be creating a simplified version of Stack Overflow, where developers can ask questions, other users can then answer these questions in real time. The answers can be voted on, the answers are then ordered by the number of up votes they have.


In this process we will create a tutorial detailing how to;
* Use Socket.io for real time updates
* Authenticate users on the website, using OAuth2
* Setup a Redis Database
* Protect against script injections
* Create tests which cover the code fully
* Implement continous integration
